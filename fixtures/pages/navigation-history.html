      <h1>History</h1>
      <p>The history of the web scraping dates back nearly to the time when the World Wide Web was born.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>After the birth of World Wide Web in 1989, the first web robot,[1] World Wide Web Wanderer, was created in June 1993, which was intended only to measure the size of the web.</li>
        <li>In December 1993, the first crawler-based web search engine, JumpStation, was launched. As there were not so many websites available on the web, search engines at that time used to rely on their human website administrators to collect and edit the links into a particular format. In comparison, JumpStation brought a new leap, being the first WWW search engine that relied on a web robot.</li>
        <li>In 2000, the first Web API and API crawler came. API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is an interface that makes it much easier to develop a program by providing the building blocks. In 2000, Salesforce and eBay launched their own API, with which programmers were enabled to access and download some of the data available to the public. Since then, many websites offer web APIs for people to access their public database.</li>
